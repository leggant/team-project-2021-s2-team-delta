issue #37

* Updated Pages controller, Student Controllers+tested - issue #36

deleted old and unused dashboard, changed index to student in pages folder, updated the web routes file removing unused routes. Tested changes, no new issues apparent through these changes

* updated add student, controller model, migration

These now include student ID fields #105, and must be unique. No error handling for these changes on the front end

* Migrations returned to orignal state-issue #36

Changes made previously will be re-added in new migration files

* Updated student migration to include first,last name

+added a character limit. changing id datatype breaks relationship with evidence, will need to change this migration before altering others

* updated new student form to include student first/last names

further testing required for these migrations, still adding errors into the database via inconsistent naming, datatypes of primary and foriegn keys

This ensures the templates use the student actual id and not the id of the record in the database

amendments also made to other migrations, to allow them to access student
